        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have had an interest in computers and technology as long as I can remember starting with my dads eMachine playing with different image softwares. I would eventually get a laptop from my parents that led me to learning how to download and install my own custom modifications to the video game minecraft teaching me the basics of a computers file system and the basics of interacting with a computer.</p>
        <p>When I got into middle school I gained interest in learning guitar and the keyboard. My interest in guitar and music in general led me to discovering recording programs such as reaper and FL studio. I would also get into hobby electronics around this time and often spend my time taking apart broken electronics and putting together circuits from my learning kit.</p>   
        <p>My first priority once I got a driver's license at 16 was to get a job and a laptop so I could do my homework more easily and having more processing power for my music programs. I would work until I was able to afford an Acer Nitro 5 with the amd hardware and it is still a solid machine for my on-the-go coding sessions. High School was a time for me to really embrace the access to information and resources I had provided to me. I would take a strong liking to my cnc machining, 3 years of German, and my physics classes.</p>
        <p>After High School I would take a little over a year to work at my local Walmart and regain my interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain leading me to my path of learning programming. I am currently taking courses to learn full stack development at <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer' target="blank">Codecademy.com</a> since May 23rd, 2021</p>
